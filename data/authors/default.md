A Web developer, tech enthusiast.

Graduated from network engineering, worked in the Internet industry for four years, and has rich development experience (mainly back-end). I have been in contact with blockchain products and development technology for two years, and now I mainly focus on the development based on the Ethereum ecosystem.

网络工程专业毕业，互联网行业工作四年,有丰富的开发经验(偏后端)。接触区块链产品及开发技术两年,现在主要关注于基于以太坊生态的开发。
